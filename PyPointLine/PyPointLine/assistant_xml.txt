We will now explain the math diagram, so please output the situation as data in the xml structure described below.
The declaration in the DTD is as follows
<!ELEMENT figures ((point|straight-line|
half-line|line-segment|circle|middle-point|
point-on-line|point-on-circle|line-tangent-circle|vertical|parallel)*)>

Please be sure to follow the rules of xml.
When specifying an ID, you must first specify one that exists.
Circles inscribed means that the circles are touching each other inside the polygon.
Intersecting means that two or more objects have one point in common through which they pass.
